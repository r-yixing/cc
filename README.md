## 🌿 About Decoded

Decoded is an AI-powered skincare analysis app that prevents skin damage before it happens. We analyze product ingredients, provide personalized recommendations based on your unique skin type, and educate you about what you're putting on your skin—all in simple, jargon-free language.

### 🎯 Our Mission

Stop guessing. Start knowing. We're here to save you money, save your skin, and help you make confident, informed skincare choices.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Personalized Onboarding**: Quick quiz to identify your skin type, goals, and budget
- **🔬 Smart Ingredient Analysis**: AI-powered scanning that considers ingredient interactions
- **✓ Clear Product Ratings**: Simple "Great Match," "Proceed with Caution," or "Not a Match" ratings
- **📚 Educational Explanations**: Learn why products work (or don't) for YOUR skin
- **💡 Better Alternatives**: Budget-filtered suggestions for poor matches
- **⭐ Premium Features**: Progress tracking, unlimited scans, detailed reports, and dermatologist referrals

4. **Prevention Focus**: Stop damage before it happens
5. **Dermatologist Network**: Direct access to board-certified professionals
6. **Budget-Conscious**: Alternatives at every price point
